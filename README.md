# IEEE Slack Welcome Bot

A Slack bot to welcome new users to our Slack team. [Join us on Slack!](https://ieee-nu.slack.com/signup)

## Setting up for development
Message @willx to be added as a collaborator and for super secret API keys and stuff.

You'll need [node package manager (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to install stuff libraries for development.

Once npm is installed, run ```npm i``` to *i*nstall all of the JS libraries you'll need.

## Run the application

You can run the application locally as a sanity check to make sure the bot starts, but you can't really test the messages.

To push a new version of the bot, run ```npm run prod```. Message @welcomebot to test.
